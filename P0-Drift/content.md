Together, we’re going to build a game called Draft, a clone of [*Drift*](https://vrjam.devpost.com/submissions/36336-drift): a first-person VR game where you play as a bullet!

Some of the things you’ll learn in this tutorial include how to:
-   Set up a VR game to only respond to rotation or translation, rather than both
-   Add Attributes to components to make them act differently in the Editor
-   Create a cool “whoosh” effect to reduce nausea
-   Apply Camera effects
-   Master Time itself!

The end of this tutorial also includes an optional, advanced section. If
you choose to complete that section as well, you’ll also learn how to:
-   Create a single class to manage your levels
-   Load levels into a unifying scene
-   Customize the Unity Editor itself!
